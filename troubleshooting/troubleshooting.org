#+TITLE: Troubleshooting ad-free

This pages describes common steps how to troubleshoot ad-free in case
ad blocking does not work.

Pictures below are based on version v2.1. They may slightly
change later versions.

** Reinstall ad-free
Remove and reinstall ad-free. Upon first usage you are asked to grant
notification access. Whether the notification service successfully
connected can be seen in settings (three dots in about fragment) in
the version segment. You can touch the _notification service is
connected_ / _notification service is disconnected_ text to launch
notification access settings to re-grant access.

and enable auto start.

found in Android app info.

** Enable always-on notifications
On some flavors of Android ad-free is being killed if the activity
runs in background. Go to ad-free settings (three dots in about
fragment) and enable always-on option. A foreground notification
should now appear in the notification drawer. This notification
appears as soon as the notification listener is connected an running.

** Advanced steps
*** Check if notification listener works
Enable developer mode in ad-free by clicking multiple times on the
title in the ad detectors screen. Go to ad-free settings (three dots)
/ ad detectors. Enable the detector _Dummy global_ which flags each
incoming notification as advertisement. If audio is not being blocked
then there is an issue with the notification listener. File an issue
on Github; https://github.com/abertschi/ad-free/issues.

*** Record notifications for a new detector.
Unlock developer mode as described above. Enable Spotify tracer and
submit the recording file as an issue on Github. The notification dump
can help adding support for new devices.
